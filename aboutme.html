            <h3 class="text">I'm <span class="name">Anthony Tubiera</span>, a student with a deep passion for music.
                 I love expressing myself through playing both the guitar and bass, 
                 and I'm always up for exploring new styles and genres. I do pretty average when it comes to my academics and I mostly focus on my skills and talents. I studied in Woodridge College at Bacoor Cavite since Kinder up until Grade 10 and I would recieve an academic award every schoolyear such as a ranking in the top 10 of my class and a "With Honors" certificate.
                 I specialize and have basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, C++, and C# when it comes to coding languages. My hobbies and interests are playing instruments, draw and paint, and play basketball every weekend.
