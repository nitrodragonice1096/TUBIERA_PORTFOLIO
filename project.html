                <h3>DON'T FLOOD MY HOUSE!</h3>
                <p>DON'T FLOOD MY HOUSE is a game that I made with my groupmates for my first GAMEX at iACADEMY. I was the main coder of the game using Godot while my groupmates focused on the other parts and it took us roughly 3 weeks to complete it. It was presented to the public at a booth at Glorietta Makati on December 9 - 11, 2024.  </p>

                <h3>Painting</h3>
                <p>This is a painting of a pond of fishes that I made during the workshop "Brush and Brew" at iACADEMY. This was my first proper visit at iACADEMY and it was a painting session, though I wouldn't say art isnt my main skill I still think I did a really good job for having 2 hours only of doing it.  </p>

                <h3>Diorama</h3>
                <p>This is a Diorama that I made during my highschool at Woodridge College and it was my first time making a diorama and it was also the time when I was skilled in arts and crafts. This Diorama is based off of a movie "Monster House".</p>
